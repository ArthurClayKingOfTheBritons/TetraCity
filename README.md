# TetraCity

Tetra City is a 2D city-building game made by VGDev at Georgia Tech in the Fall 2024 semester.

Tetra City, in a sentence, is Tetris meets SimCity meets Slay the Spire. It’s a 2D game where you buy buildings, stack them on each other, and grow your city. Certain buildings have bonus effects when placed near other buildings, so it’s important to strategize and carefully plan where each building goes.
